# Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains the code for a digit recognition project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of the project is to accurately classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. This is done to show basic CNN usecase.

## 🚀 Overview
- Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow for digit recognition.
- Implemented image preprocessing techniques such as normalization, reshaping, and label encoding.
- Utilized data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for exploratory data analysis and training progress visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `digit_recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for the project.
- `train.csv`: Dataset for training the model.
- `test.csv`: Dataset for testing the trained model.

## ⚙️ Setup and Dependencies
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow

## 📊 Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 98.9% on the validation set.
- The model is capable of recognizing hand-written digits with high precision.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
- I used the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.
