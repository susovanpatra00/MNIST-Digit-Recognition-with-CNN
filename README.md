# Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains the code for a digit recognition project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of the project is to accurately classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. This is done to show basic CNN usecase.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `digit_recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for the project.
- `train.csv`: Dataset for training the model.
- `test.csv`: Dataset for testing the trained model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Dependencies
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow
